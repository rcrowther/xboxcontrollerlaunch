ExtremeTuxRacer
---------------


Configuration 1 
  Classic XBox; accelerate and decelerate on the triggers. Buttons to do other stuff.

Configuration 2 
  Good for TuxRacer; directions on the pad/hat. Accelerate/decelerate/jump on the face buttons.

(I ought to work these into launchers, but squinting at 'man' pages for X11 codes eats my time)
